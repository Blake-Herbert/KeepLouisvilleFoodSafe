Keep Louisville's Food Safe

Since 2019, I have been employed in the Louisville food service industry, where I take food and food safety seriously. A fascinating aspect of our local industry is the wealth of information available in the Louisville Metro Government's public database, which details health code violation records. I was eager to share the contents with my chef and fellow crew members but we found the database unweildy and difficult to navigate on mobile devices due to the vast amount of information avaiable regarding each violation.

This challenge inspired the creation of "Keep Louisville's Food Safe."

I started by developing a simplified data table page, utilizing only the information that I found relevent. The restaurant name, violation notes, and date. I deliberately omitted other fields to make viewing easier, especially on mobile devices. As the project evolved, I introduced the "Guess Who" section to provide users with an opportunity to actively engage with the information rather than to only passively view it on a table.

I hope that by simplifying the presentation of data and encouraging user interaction, "Keep Louisville's Food Safe" not only serves as a valuable resource but also promotes a deeper understanding of food safety within our community.
